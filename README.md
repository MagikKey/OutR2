`OutR2` provides functions for computing predictive metrics in psychological research. 
The current version (0.1.0) includes: 
- Cross-validation and bootstrap methods (including .632+) for conducting a direct estimation of the prediction error in $MSE$ and $R^2$ metrics.
- Functions for splitting data and functions for generating data, which can be useful for conducting simulation studies.
